## Is it possible to integrate other apps with Twenty?

It's possible to integrate Twenty with other apps using middleware like Zapier, n8n, Make, Windmill, etc.
as long as said app has API interface and webhook.

## I deleted account by accident and don't have access to workspace, what can I do?

If workspace is in cloud, contact [support](support@twenty.com), if workspace was in self-hosted instance:
- if there are other users in workspace, ask them to send invite link
- if the only account in workspace was deleted, then whole workspace is deleted and all data are lost

## I want to import records but error in UI appears

If file used for importing records has more than 20,000 records, then file won't be imported due to hardcoded limit.

## Can I host Twenty in this provider?

Some providers are verified by community and can be checked [here](https://twenty.com/developers/section/self-hosting/cloud-providers).
If provider isn't listed in linked page but gives access to console, then it's likely possible to host Twenty.

## I'd like to use Twenty at my company, but I'm missing this feature, when it'll be done?

If feature you're looking for isn't on roadmap, you can create an issue or discussion with detailed explanation of requested feature and core team will review it and come back with answer.
