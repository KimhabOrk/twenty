Twenty is a CRM designed to fit your unique business needs.  
It is maintained by a community of 200+ developers that care about building high-quality software.

There are three different ways to get started:
- **Managed Cloud:** The fastest and easiest way to try the app 
- **Local Setup:** If you're a developer and would like to contribute to the app
- **Self-Hosting:** If you know how to run a server and want to host the app yourself


Once you're setup, you can check the "Extending" or "Contributing" section to start building.
